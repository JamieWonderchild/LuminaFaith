## Prerequisites Setup

### 1. Install Node.js

**What is Node.js?** Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. We need it to run our React Native app.

#### For Windows:
1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download the LTS version (Long Term Support) - it will be the green button
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts
4. Accept all default settings
5. **Important**: Check the box that says "Automatically install the necessary tools"

#### For macOS:
1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download the LTS version
3. Open the downloaded .pkg file and follow the installer

#### For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

#### Verify Installation:
Open Terminal (macOS/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows) and run:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```
You should see version numbers like `v18.17.0` and `9.6.7`

### 2. Install Git

**What is Git?** Git is a version control system that tracks changes in your code and allows you to collaborate with others.

#### For Windows:
1. Go to [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)
2. Download Git for Windows
3. Run the installer
4. **Important settings during installation**:
   - Choose "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt"
   - Choose "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings"
   - Choose "Use Windows' default console window"

#### For macOS:
Git is usually pre-installed. If not:
1. Install Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`
2. Or download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)

#### For Linux:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
```

#### Verify Installation:
```bash
git --version
```

### 3. Install Expo CLI

**What is Expo?** Expo is a platform for building React Native apps. It provides tools and services to make development easier.

```bash
npm install -g @expo/cli
```

Verify installation:
```bash
expo --version
```

### 4. Install a Code Editor

**Recommended: Visual Studio Code**
1. Go to [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download and install for your operating system
3. **Recommended Extensions** (install these after opening VS Code):
   - React Native Tools
   - ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets
   - Prettier - Code formatter
   - GitLens ‚Äî Git supercharged

## GitHub Account & Repository Setup

### 1. Create GitHub Account
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com/)
2. Click "Sign up" in the top right
3. Choose a username (this will be public)
4. Enter your email and create a password
5. Verify your email address

### 2. Clone the Repository
1. Go to [https://github.com/JamieWonderchild/LuminaFaith](https://github.com/JamieWonderchild/LuminaFaith)
2. Click the green "Code" button
3. Copy the HTTPS URL: `https://github.com/JamieWonderchild/LuminaFaith.git`
4. Open Terminal/Command Prompt

---

## Development Environment Setup

### 1. Install Project Dependencies
In your Terminal/Command Prompt, make sure you're in the LuminaFaith folder and run:
```bash
npm install
```

**This might take 5-10 minutes** - npm is downloading all the code libraries the app needs.

### 2. Check Everything is Working
Run this command to make sure everything installed correctly:
```bash
npm run type-check
```

If you see any errors, don't worry - we'll fix them in the troubleshooting section.

---

## Environment Configuration

**Important**: We'll be using a shared development environment, so you don't need to create your own database!

### 1. Get the Environment File
**Contact Jamie** to get the `.env` file with the shared database credentials. This file contains:
- Database connection details
- API keys
- Other configuration settings

### 2. Add the Environment File
1. Jamie will provide you with a `.env` file
2. Place this file in the root of your LuminaFaith folder (same level as `package.json`)
3. **Never commit this file to GitHub** - it contains sensitive information
4. The file should look something like this:
   ```env
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://shared-project.supabase.co
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=shared-anon-key-here
   EXPO_PUBLIC_PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS_PROJECT_ID=shared-project-id
   EXPO_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=true
   EXPO_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=development
   ```

### 3. Verify Environment Setup
Run this command to check if the environment is configured correctly:
```bash
npm start
```

If you see any "Supabase connection failed" errors, contact Jamie to verify your environment file.

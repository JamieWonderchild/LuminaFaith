This encounter led him to leave his comfortable life and seek understanding of suffering and the path to liberation. After years of spiritual practice, he achieved enlightenment under the Bodhi tree and spent the rest of his life teaching others.

The Buddha's teachings, known as the Dharma, form the foundation of Buddhism practiced by millions worldwide today.`,
